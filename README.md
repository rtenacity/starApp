# Calculating the type of a star based on its luminosity and temperature

This project takes in a dataset of stars, their magnitude, and temperature and classifies them into different types of stars. The data is from a
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepu1109/star-dataset) dateset, and the project uses linear regression for the analysis.

## Why?
Because I was bored.
